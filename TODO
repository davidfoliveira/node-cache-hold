* Background update
* More tests
    - Expire and grace
    - Background update call during grace
    - Background update call ongoing and queuing calls
    - Time test (load)

* Try to find a solution for queued calls being answered before calls issued before them (this is not necessarily a bad thing but maybe should be an option)
    - Call one fetches
    - Call two fetches
    - Call three is queued
    - Call one gets answer and fulfills one and three
    - Call two gets answer and fulfulls itself only
* Check whether it's possible to return always the same Promise instead of a new one?
